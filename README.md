# AI-research-project

Abstract:
The objective of this research project is to conduct a comprehensive multiclass classification analysis using the red wine subset of the Wine Quality dataset. The research project chosen is project #0, so I used the red wine data in the Wine Quality Data Set, where the task was classification, and the target value was “quality”. This project uses the PyCaret library, a low-code machine learning tool, and this tutorial guides users through various stages of the classification process. Multiple classification models are employed, including decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and others, with an emphasis on PyCaret's functionalities for easy experimentation and comparison. The workflow encompasses setting up the environment, comparing model performances, analyzing results, making predictions, saving models, and exploring interpretability through techniques like SHAP.
